# Assignment 5
## Markov Decision Process

### Usage
In order to run the program, from the command line type...
```
python MarkovSolver.py <world_text_file> <epsilon_value>
```
If no values are given, the default values will be World1MDP.txt and 0.5.

### Question to Answer
It was found that there was no epsilon value to change the optimal path.
However, there were epsilon values that affected the policy for if the horse
were to veer from the optimal path. This value occurred around 21.

### Results
Below is the optimal path, a visual representation of the policy, and information
for all nodes with epsilon = 0.5. In order to best see the results, look at the
raw README file. Note that the following results can also be generated by
running the program.
